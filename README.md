Travel Agency Advertising Campaign Analysis


Objective:

Determine the statistical success of a retargeting campaign conducted by a prominent
travel agency. The analysis involves matching and comparing two datasets -
'Abandoned.csv' (ABD) and 'Reservation.csv' (RES) - to understand customer
interactions and outcomes from the campaign.
Steps Performed:

Background:

• Two datasets: 'Abandoned.csv' (ABD) and 'Reservation.csv' (RES)

Business Justification:

• Explained the rationale behind retargeting customers who initially didn't
purchase a vacation package.
• Analyzed the test/control division to assess its execution.

Data Alignment:

• Proposed potential data keys to match customers.
• Detailed the procedure to identify customers in different groups.
• Provided a cross-tabulation of outcomes for treatment and control groups.
• Replicated the cross-tabulation for five randomly chosen states.

Data Refinement:

• Generated a cleaned dataset with columns: Customer ID, Test Group,
Outcome, State Available, Email Available.

Statistical Assessment:

• Executed a linear regression to assess the impact of the retargeting campaign.
• Justified the regression's statistical comparability to ANOVA/t-test.
• Discussed the appropriateness of the regression model for making causal
claims.
• Integrated State and Email dummies into the regression, comparing results
and providing insights.

Reflections:

• Reflected on the project, considered modifications to the experiment design,
explored alternative paths with better-quality data, and identified actionable
business implications.
• Self-assessment and anticipated performance rating.

Submission:

Ensure the final submission includes the R script, analyses, and the refined dataset.
